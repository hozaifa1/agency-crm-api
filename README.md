# Agency CRM API

A robust and efficient RESTful API for managing customer data, built with FastAPI and SQLite. This project serves as a demonstration of core backend development skills, including full CRUD functionality, data validation, and professional API design patterns.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Full CRUD Operations**  
  Create, Read, Update, and Delete customer records.
- **Data Validation**  
  Utilizes Pydantic for strict request and response data validation, ensuring data integrity.
- **Partial Updates**  
  Supports flexible PUT requests to update one or more fields of a customer record without requiring the full object.
- **Dynamic Filtering**  
  The `GET /customers/` endpoint can be filtered by status using query parameters (e.g., `/customers/?status=active`).
- **Automatic API Documentation**  
  Interactive API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI at the `/docs` endpoint.
